# protoc-gen-tonic

A `protoc` plugin that generates _[Tonic]_ gRPC server and client code using
the _[Prost!]_ code generation engine.

[Prost!]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost

When used in projects that use only Rust code, the preferred mechanism for
generating gRPC services with _Tonic_ is to use [`tonic-build`] from
within a `build.rs` file. However, when working in polyglot environments,
it can be advantageous to utilize common tooling in the Protocol Buffers
ecosystem. One common tool used for this purpose is _[buf]_, which simplifies
the code generation process and includes several useful features, including
linting, package management, and breaking change detection.

[buf]: https://buf.build

## Usage

Ensure that `protoc-gen-tonic` has been installed within a directory on your
`$PATH`. Then invoke `protoc` from the command line as follows:

```shell
protoc --tonic_out=proto/gen -I proto proto/greeter/v1/greeter.proto
```

### Options

This tool supports all the same options from `tonic-build` except for those
that are expected to have been completely handled in an earlier
`protoc-gen-prost` step. For information on the effects of these settings,
see the related documentation from `tonic-build`:

    no_server: bool,
    no_client: bool,


* `default_package_filename=<value>`: [default_package_filename](https://docs.rs/prost-build/latest/prost_build/struct.Config.html#method.default_package_filename)
* `extern_path=<proto_path>=<rust_path>`:  [extern_path](https://docs.rs/prost-build/latest/prost_build/struct.Config.html#method.extern_path)
* `compile_well_known_types(=<boolean>)`: [compile_well_known_types](https://docs.rs/prost-build/latest/prost_build/struct.Config.html#method.compile_well_known_types)
* `disable_package_emission(=<boolean>)`: [compile_well_known_types](https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/struct.Builder.html#method.disable_package_emission)
* `server_attribute=<proto_path>=<attribute>`: [server_attribute](https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/struct.Builder.html#method.server_attribute)
* `server_mod_attribute=<proto_path>=<attribute>`: [server_mod_attribute](https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/struct.Builder.html#method.server_mod_attribute)
* `client_attribute=<proto_path>=<attribute>`: [client_attribute](https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/struct.Builder.html#method.client_attribute)
* `client_mod_attribute=<proto_path>=<attribute>`: [client_mod_attribute](https://docs.rs/tonic-build/latest/tonic_build/struct.Builder.html#method.client_mod_attribute)

In addition, the following options can also be specified:

* `no_server(=<boolean>)`: Disables generation of the server modules
* `no_client(=<boolean>)`: Disables generation of the client modules

A note on parameter values:

* `<attribute>`: All `,`s appearing in the value must be `\` escaped
  (i.e. `\,`) This is due to the fact that internally, `protoc` joins all
  passed parameters with a `,` before sending it as a single string to the
  underlying plugin.
* `<proto_path>`: Protobuf paths beginning with `.` will be matched from the
  global root (prefix matches). All other paths will be matched as suffix
  matches.
* `(=<boolean>)`: Boolean values may be specified after a parameter, but if
  not, the value is assumed to be `true` by virtue of having listed the
  parameter.

### Usage with _buf_

When used with _buf_, options can be specified in the `buf.gen.yaml` file.
`protoc-gen-prost-tonic` should appear as a plugin step after any
`protoc-gen-prost` steps. In addition, 

```yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  - name: prost
    out: gen
  - name: tonic
    out: gen
```

If you have specified `compile_well_known_types` or `extern_path` on any
earlier step, those should also be specified for this step.

```yaml
version: v1
plugins:
  - name: prost
    out: gen
    opt:
      - include_file
  - name: prost
    out: gen
    opt:
      - compile_well_known_types
      - extern_path=.google.protobuf=::pbjson_types
  - name: prost-serde
    out: gen
  - name: tonic
    out: gen
    opt:
      - compile_well_known_types
      - extern_path=.google.protobuf=::pbjson_types
```
